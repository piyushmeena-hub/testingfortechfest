# run_ardupilot_sitl.sh - convenience launcher for N ArduCopter SITL instances.
#
# This is meant to be run by a human on a Linux box (e.g. the acg-kali-style
# test VM) that already has ArduPilot set up, NOT something exercised in CI
# or from the Windows dev host. It just saves typing out N `sim_vehicle.py`
# invocations with the right instance numbers / output ports by hand.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - ArduPilot cloned and built (https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-setup-linux.html)
#   - Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py on your PATH, or run this script from
#     inside your ArduPilot checkout so the relative path below resolves.
#     (Adjust SIM_VEHICLE below if your layout differs.)
#   - Python deps sim_vehicle.py itself needs (MAVProxy, etc.) already
#     installed, per the ArduPilot SITL setup docs.
#
# What it does: launches N ArduCopter SITL instances (instance numbers
# 0..N-1), each forwarding its MAVLink stream via --out=udp:127.0.0.1:PORT
# to a distinct UDP port that bridge.py listens on (udpin) for that vehicle.
# Port for instance i = 14550 + 10*i, matching bridge.py's default
# --mav-base-port=14550 assumption (see the comment in bridge.py's module
# docstring for why this spacing was chosen).
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_ardupilot_sitl.sh [N]      # N defaults to 3
#
# Then, in another terminal:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   python bridge.py --count N
#
set -euo pipefail

N="${1:-3}"
BASE_PORT=14550

# Adjust this if sim_vehicle.py isn't already on PATH.
