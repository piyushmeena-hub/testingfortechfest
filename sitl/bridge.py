"""bridge.py - browser WebSocket <-> ArduPilot/PX4 SITL MAVLink bridge.

This is the "real" half of the pair (see mock_vehicles.py for the
no-firmware stand-in that speaks the identical WebSocket protocol).

Architecture
------------
    browser sim  <--WebSocket(JSON)-->  bridge.py  <--MAVLink/UDP-->  SITL

The browser never speaks MAVLink; it only sends "init"/"goals" and receives
"ready"/"status"/"telemetry" JSON messages (see the protocol docstrings on
each handler below, and README.md for the full table). This module's job is
purely translation + plumbing: JSON goal <-> MAVLink SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED,
and MAVLink LOCAL_POSITION_NED <-> JSON telemetry, per vehicle.

Coordinate frame (shared contract with the browser sim and mock_vehicles.py):
    sim world:  x = metres East, y = metres South (screen-down positive),
                alt = metres above ground.
    MAVLink:    local NED = (North, East, Down), metres.

    sim -> NED:  ned_north = -sim_y ; ned_east = sim_x ; ned_down = -alt
    NED -> sim:  sim_x = ned_east   ; sim_y = -ned_north ; alt = -ned_down

One task per vehicle, one reader per socket (findings #12/#13)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Each vehicle gets exactly ONE asyncio task (`vehicle_task`), started the
moment "init" creates it. That task is the only code that ever reads the
vehicle's MAVLink socket, and it does two things on every poll:

  1. drains `recv_match(blocking=False)` into vehicle state (heartbeat time,
     armed/mode flags, COMMAND_ACKs, LOCAL_POSITION_NED -> sim x/y/alt), so
     telemetry flows from tick one and is NEVER gated on some other
     vehicle's init finishing (finding #13b), and
  2. advances a per-vehicle init state machine off those same messages:

        wait-heartbeat --(HEARTBEAT seen; send SET_MODE GUIDED)-->
        confirm-mode   --(HEARTBEAT.custom_mode == GUIDED id; send arm)-->
        confirm-arm    --(COMMAND_ACK(ARM)=ACCEPTED *and* HEARTBEAT.base_mode
                          & MAV_MODE_FLAG_SAFETY_ARMED; send NAV_TAKEOFF)-->
        confirm-takeoff--(COMMAND_ACK(TAKEOFF)=ACCEPTED, then telemetry alt
                          climbs past TAKEOFF_CONFIRM_ALT_M)--> ready

     Each step re-sends its command every STEP_RESEND_DT and gives up after
     INIT_STEP_TIMEOUT_S, landing in state "failed:<step>". Nothing is ever
     reported as done that wasn't confirmed by an acknowledgement, a
     heartbeat flag or actual measured climb (finding #12).

A failed vehicle's task keeps polling. When its heartbeat (re)appears the
sequence restarts from the earliest *unsatisfied* step, so a SITL instance
that boots long after "ready" was sent still gets armed and taken off with
no new "init" from the browser (finding #13a).

Readiness is reported PER VEHICLE: the "ready" reply keeps the flat `ids`
list the browser needs, and adds `vehicles: [{id, ready, state}]` alongside
it. "status" lines narrate the per-vehicle truth ("arm REJECTED ..."), never
a success that wasn't confirmed.

Flight origin (F05)
-------------------
Every vehicle coordinates travels in the COMMON LOCAL ORIGIN frame the
browser fixes at connect/init time and sends in the "init" message:
telemetry x/y/alt are origin-relative (NED position minus origin XY, -z
minus origin ground height), and outgoing goals are origin-relative too.
The origin is captured ONCE at connect/init -- a movable base or dragged
target never rewrites it -- so the whole pipeline round-trips in one frame
and a landing commanded at a different ground elevation still descends to
ground, not to NED zero.

Landing/swap/relaunch services (F04)
------------------------------------
A vehicle returns to base ONLY through the explicit browser-driven service
handshake, never an implicit setpoint to alt 0: the controller sends
{"type":"service","id","requestId","action":"land"} -> the bridge commands
MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND, flips the vehicle out of `ready` (no more goals), and
waits for fresh disarmed+EXTENDED_SYS_STATE(landed) evidence AFTER the
request (state "landed") -> the browser authorizes the battery swap
("swapping") -> later asks for completion ("swapped") -> finally "relaunch"
re-enters the standard init sequence from GUIDED with a NEW takeoff
altitude, and goals stay suppressed until the full climb is re-confirmed
and the vehicle is ready again. Every step is guarded by
`service_grounded`: fresh heartbeat + fresh position + landed, all newer
than the request, so a low hover, stale samples or a constant-seq heartbeat
can never masquerade as touchdown. Failed arm/takeoff during relaunch keeps
the vehicle parked (failed:<step>); nothing rearms itself outside this
handshake.

Ownership (finding #13c)
------------------------
The socket whose "init" built the current fleet is the controller. While
that socket is open, "init"/"goals" from any other client are refused with a
status line and change nothing -- a second browser tab can watch telemetry
but cannot stomp a flying fleet. When the controller disconnects the fleet
keeps flying and the next "init" from anyone takes over.

Per-vehicle MAVLink connection convention
------------------------------------------
`sim_vehicle.py -I<i> ... --out=udp:127.0.0.1:<PORT>` (see
run_ardupilot_sitl.sh) forwards vehicle i's MAVLink stream to
udp:127.0.0.1:<PORT>. We assume PORT = --mav-base-port + 10*i (default base
14550), which matches the ports printed by run_ardupilot_sitl.sh and is the
conventional spacing ArduPilot's own tooling uses for multi-vehicle SITL
(instance 0 -> 14550, instance 1 -> 14560, ...). This bridge listens with
`udpin:localhost:PORT` for each vehicle -- i.e. *we* are the UDP server and
SITL's --out is the UDP client connecting to us, so no port needs to be open
on the SITL side and NAT/firewall setup stays simple.

Dependencies: `websockets` and `pymavlink` (see requirements.txt).
`pymavlink` is intentionally not installed in every environment this repo
lives in (it's only needed on the box actually running SITL/talking MAVLink);
if the import below fails, run:

    pip install pymavlink

test_bridge.py exercises this module with stub `pymavlink`/`websockets`
modules and a scripted fake autopilot, so the state machine above is
testable (mock-verified) without either dependency or any firmware.
