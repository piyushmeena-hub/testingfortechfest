# Drone swarm relay simulator


install, runs in your browser.

A browser-based simulation of a drone swarm that keeps itself connected to its
operator by **turning its own members into a self-healing radio relay mesh** —
the way a flock of birds would solve a comms problem. Fly the mission far
enough away and drones peel off to bridge the link; kill a relay and the
swarm heals; drop an interference source and the swarm maps the dead zone and
routes around it; run a battery down and drones excuse themselves and fly home.

## The real-world problem

Whenever a team of drones has to work somewhere **without communications
infrastructure** — and the distance, terrain, or radio interference keeps
breaking the link to the operator — you have this project's problem. It shows
up everywhere:

- **Disaster response & search-and-rescue** — earthquakes, floods, wildfires,
  avalanches: cell towers are down or mountains block the signal, and a
  self-relaying swarm has to search while staying linked to the command post.
- **Wildfire & infrastructure monitoring** — persistent overwatch across
  ridgelines and valleys that shadow radio; relays keep the cameras connected.
- **Long linear inspection** — power lines, pipelines, railways, borders,
  coastlines: a moving relay chain keeps beyond-line-of-sight drones online.
- **Conservation & anti-poaching** — vast parks with zero infrastructure.
- **Mining, ports, large industrial sites** — exactly where "never-break" mesh
  radios (Rajant, Silvus) are already deployed.
- **Contested / degraded-comms operations** — the hardest version of the same
  problem, where the interference is deliberate.

The common thread: **keep the swarm connected across distance, terrain, and
interference, using the drones themselves as the network.** This simulator
lets you design and stress-test that — against real radio hardware specs,
real terrain, and real interference — before spending a cent on drones.

## Why it's interesting

Most swarm demos are animations: an all-knowing script moves dots around.
This one is a **distributed system**. There are three separate worlds that
only communicate through simulated radio packets:

- **Truth** — actual positions, batteries, and RF physics
- **C2's beliefs** — built *only* from telemetry packets that physically
  arrived, hop by hop, at the ground station
- **Each drone's beliefs** — the last order packet it received, and how long
  ago it last heard from C2

Every command and telemetry report is a packet that routes through the relay
chain with real per-hop airtime, gets lost to fading, and simply never
arrives if no route exists. When you kill a mid-chain relay, C2 doesn't
"know" — it notices the telemetry silence a few seconds later, strikes the
drone off its roster, and re-plans with whatever it can still reach.
Chains heal end-to-end without any component having the full picture.

### The fallback engine (link recovery, both sides)

Link loss is recovered from **both ends**, using each side's memory of where
the link last worked:

- **Drone side** — every drone stamps the position where the last command
  physically reached it. On link timeout it runs a ladder: *hold → retreat
  to that last-link point and listen → fall back one radio-range step toward
  base and listen again → third strike → only then RTL home.* Three attempts
  before the mission position is abandoned — base is the last resort, not
  the first one.
- **C2 side** — the ground station remembers where every lost drone was
  last heard (rendered as dashed ghost markers). After a grace period it
  dispatches a rescue drone toward that point — held one link-length from
  the nearest connected node, so the searcher itself stays reachable. When
  the lost drone's telemetry reappears through the extended coverage, both
  are re-tasked and the mission resumes where it left off.

Rescuers chain off each other (up to three deep): the first anchors on the
nearest connected node, each next one on the rescuer before it, and the
tentacle crawls toward the lost group's last-known position with every
member tethered as it goes.

### The commitment rule

Methodology borrowed from [MIT ACL's FASTER
planner](https://github.com/mit-acl/faster) (not its code): *never commit to
a plan unless a backup plan provably closes.* FASTER applies it to
trajectories in unknown terrain; here it's applied to energy. Before a drone
adopts any in-flight tasking — relay slot, rescue point, new mission target —
it checks that flying there still leaves enough battery to get home against
the current wind, with pessimism margin and reserve intact. If not, it
declines the order, keeps flying its current (already-vetted) one, and
reports the refusal; C2 benches it for a while and elects a drone that can
actually afford the job. A drone that says yes has proven it can also say
goodbye safely.

### The tether rule

The swarm's most bird-like behavior: **no drone ever outruns its link.**
C2 names each drone's upstream chain neighbor in every order; the drone
tracks that neighbor's beacon RSSI (smoothed), and as the measured margin
sinks toward a floor it stops extending — and below the floor it closes
back in. Retreats and homeward flights are never blocked; the tether only
stops you from flying *away* from your own connectivity. Deployment
becomes a caterpillar unroll — the flock waits for the chain instead of
sprinting into blackout — and in bad RF the chain compresses automatically,
spacing itself by measured link quality instead of planned geometry.

Measured effect: launch-phase dark time drops to zero, and the urban
scenario at 50 m AGL goes from ~15% link uptime (swarm repeatedly marooned
in street canyons) to 100%, with the mission still reaching its target.

### Corridor transit

Second borrowing from FASTER's methodology (safe corridors): far transits
converge onto the base→target spine — where the relay chain lives — and
travel along it, peeling off only for the final hop. A toggle in Mission
setup switches it off for comparison.

Measured honestly: in today's obstacle-free world this changes transit
paths but rarely changes connectivity. Two emergent reasons: when the
mission retargets, the relays re-slot along the rotating line, so the whole
swarm sweeps together and escorts itself; and every drone is a mesh node,
so group transits carry their own coverage. Corridors start earning their
keep when transits are solo and the world has radio dead zones — i.e. once
terrain and the learned RF coverage map (roadmap) exist, corridors will
bend around *measured* dead zones instead of following a straight spine.
Same dependency as FASTER itself: corridors need a map to matter.

## Tier-1 capabilities (the DDIL edition)

Six features that map this sim onto funded-RFP language — all software-only,
all tested:

- **Heterogeneous swarms** — mix airframes AND radios in one mission
  (*Mixed fleet* in Mission setup): an endurance relay wing on long-range
  radios holds the backhaul while tactical drones fly the objective on cheap
  short-range hardware. Link budgets between different radios are computed per
  direction over each radio's own calibrated curve; band-incompatible nodes
  simply cannot hear each other. C2 elects wing units for relay duty, keeps
  them off rescue tasking, and always plans a *tactical-tail slot* so the
  short-legged flock can actually hang off the chain.
- **GPS-denied navigation** (*Interference → Add GPS outage*) — inside a
  denial zone drones fly on dead reckoning: their believed position integrates
  airspeed with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck drift, they steer by that belief (and miss
  slots by exactly their nav error), and telemetry poisons C2's picture of
  where they are. The planner hedges: relay slots sidestep zones it cannot
  trust positions in.
- **Anti-jam spectrum agility + LPI/LPD** (*Mission setup*) — frequency-hopping
  presets (Doodle Mesh Rider, Silvus, ELRS) shed a datasheet-class amount of
  interference when agility is on; LPI waveforms trade 3 dB of link budget for
  6 dB of denial rejection; denial zones visibly shrink for agile chains; link
  uptime is measured so recovery is a number, not an adjective.
- **Payload/video backhaul** (*Mission setup → Video backhaul*) — streamed
  chunks are real packets paying real airtime on the one shared channel.
  C2 grants ONE streamer at a time in round-robin turns delivered inside order
  packets; chunk delivery/loss is accounted, the fleet panel marks who holds
  the channel, and video visibly starves C2 traffic (and vice versa).
- **DDIL scenario pack** (*Scenario → dropdown*) — five one-click seeded
  scenarios: GPS-denied crossing, jammed corridor on an agile MANET,
  intermittent urban canyons, duty-cycle-limited LoRa with a starving video
  scheduler, and the full combination (mixed fleet + jammer + GNSS denial +
  LPI + payload). Each is plain JSON-shaped data — save/load compatible.
- **Sim-to-real calibration loop** (*Calibration section*) — feed any CSV log
  of RSSI vs distance from real hardware (`dist,rssi` or `x,y[,z],rssi`);
  least-squares fits the path-loss exponent and reference power with RMSE/R²,
  re-derives a field-calibrated radio preset whose model exponent equals your
  measurement, and emits a Markdown validation report with per-band residuals.
  This is the loop that turns the simulator from plausible into validated.

## Tier-2 capabilities (the moat)

Five features that make this hard to copy — all software-only, all tested:

- **Vertical mission library** (*Mission library* section) — one-click
  templates for the industries this sells into: SAR grid search, wildfire
  front overwatch, pipeline linear inspection, convoy escort, perimeter
  patrol. Each carries an operator checklist. Two of them MOVE: in **convoy
  escort** the ground station itself drives at road speed while the chain
  re-plans live behind it; in **wildfire** the objective drifts downwind and
  the flock follows.
- **Red-team adversary mode** (*Interference → Red-team mode*) — interference
  sources direction-find the swarm's own transmissions (sensor-honest: no
  god view, just a radio receiver) and crawl toward the recency-weighted
  traffic centroid at limited ground speed. A denial zone that hunts. Uptime
  with hunting vs static jammers is measurable; the report accounts for how
  far the adversary moved.
- **ATAK / TAK integration** (*ATAK / TAK section*) — exports the live common
  operating picture as Cursor-on-Target atoms: every drone, the command post,
  the objective, and denial/GNSS-dead zones as ellipse hazards. Download a
  snapshot `.xml`, or stream live (5 s cadence) through `sitl/tak_bridge.py`
  onto TAK's UDP multicast (`239.2.3.1:6969`) where real ATAK clients
  subscribe. Import someone else's CoT marks onto the map; one click turns
  any mark into the mission objective. Georeferencing reuses a loaded OSM
  area's exact anchor, or an operator origin (equirectangular, sub-metre at
  these scales).
- **Scale: 100+ nodes** — drone slider to 120. Upstream routing uses one
  C2-rooted shortest-path tree refreshed on a 0.5 s cadence instead of a
  Dijkstra per packet (16× faster at n=100), separation runs on a uniform
  neighbor grid. `node bench/run.js` regenerates `bench/BASELINE.md` —
  committed numbers so performance regressions diff in review. At scale the
  binding constraint is the shared channel, honestly.
- **Batch Monte Carlo + REST API** — `node tools/batch.js --config
  batch/example.json` sweeps parameter cells across seeds overnight and emits
  a Markdown confidence report (uptime/loss/contact as mean ± sd, p05/p95)
  plus raw CSV. Same engine served over zero-dependency HTTP:
  `node tools/server.js`, then `POST /api/batch`. The bundled example already
  surfaced a quotable finding: in dense urban terrain with short-range
  radios, LOWER altitude holds more uptime than high altitude.

## The radio model (and its honesty)

Every radio preset is a real product with datasheet numbers — TX power,
receiver sensitivity, frequency, air rate, and the vendor's claimed
line-of-sight range (sources in [RADIOS.md](RADIOS.md)).

Free-space path loss alone would predict absurd ranges (a 100 mW SiK radio
"reaches" 290 km in free space; in the field it does 300 m near the ground).
So the model uses **log-distance path loss with a per-radio exponent
calibrated so the link margin hits exactly 0 dB at the vendor's rated LOS
range**. That single fitted parameter absorbs ground reflection, Fresnel
losses, and antenna reality. On top of that sit:

- **Log-normal shadowing** — an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dB offset per link
  (σ = 2.5 dB open field → 6.5 dB urban), so links breathe and flicker
- **Packet error curve** — success probability is logistic in margin
  (50% at +2 dB, ~95% at +6 dB), with per-hop link-layer retries
- **3D slant range** and a **4/3-Earth radio horizon** — beyond
  `4.12(√h₁+√h₂) km` the planet blocks the link no matter the power
- **Shared-channel contention** — every transmission (and retry) occupies
  the one frequency; C2 traffic overhead visibly eats chain throughput
- **Regulatory duty cycle** (EU868 LoRa preset) — throttles telemetry and
  command rates; failsafe timeouts scale to match, like PX4's `COM_DL_LOSS_T`

**What this is:** a planning-grade sandbox whose numbers stay anchored to
real hardware behavior. **What this is not:** an RF certification tool. The
calibrated exponent is a modeling choice, stated here so you can judge it.

## The energy model

No endurance sliders. Airframes are defined by mass, rotor disc area, and
battery watt-hours; hover power comes from actuator-disc momentum theory at
a lumped 0.55 powertrain efficiency, forward flight adds a cubic drag term,
and endurance *emerges* — within a couple of minutes of the real aircraft
each preset is modeled on (sub-250 g micro ≈ 36 min, 450-class ≈ 22 min,
endurance X8 ≈ 46 min). Drones run wind-aware smart-RTH: energy to get home
is continuously re-estimated, and they leave while they still can.

Wind is a ground-frame/air-frame split: speed limits and power draw are paid
in airspeed, so holding a relay slot in a 10 m/s wind costs real watts, and
a 16 m/s gale blows a 14 m/s quad backwards.

## Terrain and the learned coverage map

Terrain (Mission setup → Terrain) is a fractal-noise heightfield — endless
seeded rolling hills and valleys, sampled analytically at any point — plus
procedural city districts: street grids of low-rise blocks with a
scattering of 60-140 m towers. Radio links need genuine line of sight over
both (with a Fresnel clearance that tapers at the antennas). Drones fly
terrain-following (AGL), so ridges between valleys cut links even though
nobody crashes; buildings taller than the flight altitude are no-fly boxes
the drones steer around (they carry a terrain database, like real
autopilots — and so does C2, which never plans a relay slot inside a
tower). Try the urban preset at 50 m AGL, watch the swarm suffer in the
street canyons, then raise the altitude slider over the low-rise — measured
uptime goes from ~15% to 100%, which is exactly how real urban BVLOS works.

The **3D view** button (header) switches to a FASTER-style perspective
render — shaded terrain mesh, extruded buildings, drones on altitude stems,
link lines colored by health. Drag to orbit, wheel to zoom.

What no terrain database can predict is the *RF shadow* — the region where
hops between valid positions still die because the hill cuts the ray. That
part the swarm has to learn: while disconnected, every drone's black box
logs where the silence happened; on reconnect the samples upload, and C2
paints a coverage grid — green where packets provably arrived, red where
drones sat in silence, unpainted where nobody has checked (FASTER's
known-free / unknown / occupied space, in radio form). Relay slots that
land in measured-bad cells get sidestepped to the nearest trusted cell —
so after a few minutes of honest struggle, the chain physically bends
around the hill and stays connected.

Measured in the ridge scenario: ~8 sim-minutes of failures while the map
fills in, then a bent chain (relays up to ~100 m off-spine) holding 100%
uptime. The heatmap overlay (Coverage map toggle) shows the whole thing
happening.

And the chain itself is **path-planned**: C2 runs A* over everything it
legitimately knows — terrain obstacles from its elevation database plus
measured-bad coverage cells — places relay slots along the resulting path,
then LOS-validates every adjacent hop against the terrain model and adds a
relay ON a ridge rather than accept a dead hop across it. Chains snake
around cities and over hills instead of dying on straight lines. (Measured:
the mixed-terrain low-altitude scenario goes from a chain that breaks in
steady state to 95% uptime with the flock on target, using one extra
densified relay along a path 1.1× the straight-line distance.)

## Real places (OpenStreetMap import)

Terrain → **Real area (OpenStreetMap)** turns the sim loose on actual
geography: type a place name ("Connaught Place Delhi", "Shibuya") or paste
`lat, lon` from any map app, pick a radius, and Load. The sim fetches the
real building footprints and heights for that spot from the public Overpass
API and drops the swarm over them — same LOS physics, same routing, same 3D
view, but over the city you actually care about: your neighbourhood, a
disaster-response sector, an inspection corridor.

And it's map-first: with a real area loaded, the 2D canvas stops being an
abstract dark plane and renders the *actual map* — genuine OSM cartography
(CARTO dark tiles), streets and parks and block layout — with the swarm,
relay chain, coverage and interference drawn on top, the way a professional
ground-control station does it. Pan and zoom (mouse or pinch) work on the
map itself. The map is the picture; the fetched buildings remain the
physics — a river on the tile does not block radio, and we don't pretend it
does.

Honesty notes, because the physics depends on them: OSM building heights are
used when surveyed, estimated from floor counts when not (the UI shows the
split); a small staging clearing is carved at the GCS and objective; very
dense fetches keep the largest 6,000 buildings (the UI says when); ground
under a real city is flat in this version. Needs internet (this is the one
feature that does); saved scenarios store the coordinates and re-fetch on
load. Building data © [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

## Things to try

1. **Kill a relay** (click it, then *Kill*) — watch C2 lose telemetry,
   re-plan, and the chain heal.
1. **Drag the operator** (the C2 marker) — the chain re-plans live and pulls
   extra relays as you walk away from the flock. Teleport it far beyond radio
   range and you'll honestly lose contact: nobody in the flock can know where
   C2 went without a link to hear it from.
2. **Switch radio to LoRa EU868** — kilometres of range, but the duty cycle
   stretches command rounds to ~40 s and the swarm gets visibly sluggish.
3. **Set environment to Urban** — usable range collapses to 20%, links
   flicker, more relays get pulled off the mission.
4. **RFD900x at 30 m altitude vs 120 m** — the radio horizon, not the power
   budget, is the binding constraint at 40 km scale.
5. **Crank wind to 12 m/s** — upwind legs crawl, relays burn battery holding
   station, RTB triggers early.
6. **Load *Full DDIL* from the Scenario dropdown** — mixed fleet, jammer,
   GNSS denial over the objective, LPI waveforms, and a 300 kbps video feed
   all fighting for one channel. Then toggle spectrum agility off mid-run and
   watch link uptime fall.
7. **Enable *Mixed fleet*** — an X8 relay wing on RFD900x radios bridges
   3 km while SiK-equipped micros work the target; kill a wing relay and
   watch C2 re-elect another *wing* unit, not a tactical one.
8. **Add a GPS outage over the objective** — drones cross on dead reckoning,
   miss their slots by tens of metres, and C2's picture of them drifts with
   them. Toggle the zone off and navigation snaps back.
9. **Load *Convoy escort* from the Mission library** — the C2 marker drives
   itself across the map at road speed while the relay wing re-forms behind
   it. This is the demo clip.
10. **Switch on *Red-team mode*** with two jammers placed — they stop sitting
   still and start hunting whoever transmits.
11. **Run the overnight study** — `node tools/batch.js --config batch/example.json`
    and read the confidence report it writes; or serve the same thing as an
    API: `node tools/server.js`, `curl -X POST localhost:8090/api/batch -d @batch/example.json`.

## Tests

```
node --test
```

## Interference / RF denial

Add an **interference source** (the Interference panel) and drag it onto the
map. It raises the noise floor in an area — modelling anything from congested
urban spectrum or a downed tower to deliberate jamming — propagating with the
same path loss and terrain shadowing as any signal. Because it feeds straight
into the link-margin model, everything else reacts on its own: the coverage
map paints the dead zone red, the tether keeps drones from flying blind into
it, and the routing bends the chain around it. Tune each source's power, or
switch it off, to sweep the whole range from a mild noisy environment to a
total denial. A localized source the swarm skirts and still completes the
mission; a source blocking the only corridor is the honest failure — the
swarm maps it, holds its connected frontier, and reports it.

## Scenario save/load and after-action reports

- **Save/Load scenario** serializes every setting plus placed interference
  sources to a JSON file, so a study or demo is reproducible and shareable.
- **After-action report** exports a Markdown mission summary — did the link
  hold, how many relays and failsafes, what dead zones were mapped, packet
  loss, interference survived — the artifact a planner or customer actually
  wants out of a run (clearly marked as a simulation result, not flight data).

## Packet capture

Tick the "Packet capture" box (Mission setup) to record every network event —
sends, per-hop forwards with their retry count and link margin, deliveries,
drops (no-route or link-fail), and broadcast receptions. "Export capture"
downloads it as JSONL (one JSON event per line), a portable trace any tool
can parse — think tcpdump for the mesh. Schema is documented at the top of
[js/net.js](js/net.js) (`exportCaptureJSONL`).

## Flying real autopilots (SITL bridge)

The swarm logic here can command actual autopilot firmware instead of the
built-in physics. In "external vehicle" mode the browser keeps running every
bit of its C2 logic — planning, ETX routing, the tether, coverage learning —
but the drones are flown by ArduPilot/PX4 SITL (or a mock), reached over a
WebSocket bridge:

```
browser sim  <--WebSocket-->  bridge.py  <--MAVLink/UDP-->  SITL
```

Positions come back from the vehicles; C2's relay goals go out as MAVLink
guided-mode setpoints. It's the same code that runs the pure sim — only the
motion is externalized. See [sitl/README.md](sitl/README.md). You can try the
whole pipeline with **zero firmware** using the mock vehicle server
(`python sitl/mock_vehicles.py`, then "Fly via bridge" in the sim).
